 Progress and activity indicators are visual indications of an app loading content.
 
 A single visual indicator should be used to represent each type of operation. For example, a refresh operation should display either a refresh bar or an activity circle, but not both.
 
 * **Determinate** indicators display how long an operation will take.
 * **Indeterminate** indicators visualize an unspecified wait time.
