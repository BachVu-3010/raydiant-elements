## Include React

Elements relies on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), so make sure you include it in your application before including Elements.

## Styling

To enable Elements styling, you need to wrap the components in Elements' `App` component. You can choose between a `light` and `dark` look by providing a `theme` argument.
